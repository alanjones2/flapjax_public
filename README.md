# Flapjax - Public
### An approach to Data visualisation with Flask, Python and Plotly

This repo is he public version of the code that I have developed for tutorials about Flapjax.

Flapjax stands for **F**lask, **P**ython and **J**avascript with **ax** representing the asynchronous communication that enables this technique.

All the code here is available for download and use in your own projects but please bear in mind that it is for educational and illustrative use and not necessarily suitable for production code.
